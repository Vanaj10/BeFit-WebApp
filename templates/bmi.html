        BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measurement of body fat based on height and
        weight that applies to both men and women between the ages of 18 and 65 years. BMI can be
        used to indicate if you are overweight, obese, underweight or normal. A healthy BMI score
        is between 20 and 25. A score below 20 indicates that you may be underweight; a value above
        25 indicates that you may be overweight
